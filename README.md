## Build Setup

Make sure you have installed and are using:
```json
"node": ">=8.0.0",
"npm": ">=5.0.0"
```

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

If `node-sass` is giving you sass (not output, just sassiness) try `npm rebuild --force` but be aware of its effects.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
